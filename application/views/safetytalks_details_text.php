<h4>Description:</h4> 
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A brief conversation held with workers to review safety issues in the workplace, ongoing work practices, new procedures, and a way to relay information on workplace activities.  Safety talks be held as often as necessary (at minimum on a weekly basis) and be about 10-15 minutes in length to provide continual safety awareness for all workers.  Workers should be notified of the specified time and location of the safety meeting
If there are issues that workers have brought up during the meeting then the person conducting the meeting must do all that they can to address them in a timely and effective manner. If these points are not addressed in an effective manner workers begin to lose faith in the internal responsibility system of the employer and start believing that supervisors and managers do not really care.</p>
