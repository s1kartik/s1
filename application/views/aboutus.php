 <h4>About the S1 System</h4>
<p>As a former Inspector, I came to realize that Every fatality CAN be avoided and every injury CAN be prevented….. It all comes down to the Three principles of safety: Recognition, Assessment and Control of hazards. Too many workers including young and vulnerable workers have a great disadvantage at work when it comes to Health and Safety and not surprisingly the lack of or limited training played a factor in 99% of my investigations. So we wondered, if workers and employers had access to affordable, easily accessible Health and Safety information in a language the workers understand and give workplace parties a proactive reason to learn and instruct their workers, could we reduce the number of injuries and fatalities?</p>
<p>With your help, were about to find out...</p>
<p>Introducing S1,</p>
<p>The first worker and employer incentive based Digital Due Diligence system designed to raise the level of awareness of Health and Safety for its members in multiple languages while rewarding you for learning. The more you learn about Safety the more points you earn, the more points you earn the quicker you "Rank Up". The higher the rank, the better discounts you get at your favourite stores. Stay safe and earn discounts. It’s that easy!</p>
