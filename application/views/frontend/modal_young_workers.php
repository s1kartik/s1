	<h4 class="s1content_title">What Employers Need to Know</h4>
    <hr class="s1content_line" />
	<p class="s1content_body_section">The Ministry of Labour has identified that new and young workers are much more likely to be injured on the job. Young workers — and new workers of any age – are often keen to learn and can bring new ideas and energy to your workplace. However, young workers often can’t recognize health and safety hazards and may hesitate to ask questions.</p>

		<h4 class="s1content_subtitle">How to be a Proactive Employer</h4>
		<p class="s1content_body_section">The safety of all workers is important, however protecting young workers who are inexperienced and have never come across work related hazards, been trained on how to use equipment or handled corrosive chemicals before is something that requires more guidance and attention from all workplace parties (employers, supervisors and experienced workers) to ensure they work safely.</p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">Employers have the most duties and responsibilities under the OHSA to ensure workers health and safety, but there are also ways that employers can be proactive and stay ahead of workplace injuries and traumatic fatalities, some ideas on how to be a proactive employer includes:</p>
		<ul>
        	<li class="s1content_body_section">Having health and safety in your company’s strategic plan.

		<h4 class="s1content_subtitle">Keeping Young Workers Safe</h4>
		<p class="s1content_body_section">
Employers have the responsibility of ensure that either they or a competent worker (usually a supervisor) take the steps needed to ensure young workers are aware of all hazards, safety issues and implications to how they perform their jobs. 
        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">
When starting work there are so many things young workers need to know and often times are too inexperienced to identify what they really need to be aware of.  S1 has developed a quick check list for young workers to guide them on their journey into the workforce.
        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_title">
Training
        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">
A proper orientation and training package is important especially for young workers who are new to the job and to the workforce.  An orientation of the workplace, what to do in case of an emergency, what to do when injured in the workplace and who the health and safety rep or JHSC members are is a good way to get to know the worker and help them feel more relaxed in their work environment.        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">
Training for young workers is just as important, if not more to ensuring they are following safe work practices and working safely.  Young workers need to be trained thoroughly in ALL aspects of the job and the workplace as this will be their first exposure to work related hazards, chemical handling, using PPE and other aspects of the job they will be performing.  It is important that they have a complete understanding of what to do in all situations and supervisors need to ensure they are clear on the implications of not working safely.         </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">
Employers and supervisors should take their time to train the worker and never assume or chalk things up as common sense.        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_title">
Supervision
        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">
Ensure supervisors are introduced to the young worker prior to them starting their job.  It has been identified that lack of supervision and poor or inadequate training or the leading causes of young worker injury and death.  Supervisors should ensure they or another competent work (see the definition under the OHSA) are there to observe the young worker during their work day and provide them with direction and answer any questions the worker may have.         </p>
<p class="s1content_body_title">
Personal Protective Equipment
        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">
It is important for employers and/or supervisors to identify the types of safety equipment or devices that are required in the workplace and ensure that they are made available to all workers, and that it is adequately inspected and maintained.         </p>

		<h4 class="s1content_subtitle">Employment Standards</h4>
		<p class="s1content_body_section">
The key areas in the Employment Standards Act (ESA) that employers and supervisors must follow relate to hours of work, rest periods, overtime, minimum wage, pay day, vacation time and pay, public holidays, leave of absence, termination notice and pay and young workers.  The ESA is a law that sets minimum standards for workplaces in the province of Ontario.  If you are a unionized environment, the collective agreement(s) may have superior language that exceeds the minimum requirements set in the ESA.  Let’s look at these in more detail.        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">
<span class="s1content_body_title">Hours of work:  </span>
Generally workers cannot be forced to work more than 8 hours daily or 48 hours weekly.  There may be exceptions to this, but your employer has to meet conditions outlined in the ESA (ESA section 17).       
 </p>
    <p class="s1content_body_section">
<span class="s1content_body_title">Rest periods:  </span>
Workers must have at least 11 consecutive hours off work each day and 24 consecutive hours off each week, or 48 consecutive hours every two weeks (ESA section 20). 
</p>    
    <p class="s1content_body_section">
<span class="s1content_body_title">Overtime:  </span>
Workers must be paid overtime after 44 hours worked per week at a rate of 1.5 the regular rate (ESA section22).  
</p>    
<p class="s1content_body_section">
<span class="s1content_body_title">Minimum wage: </span>
A general minimum wage applies to most workers (ESA section 23).  This minimum wage is published in this website:   <a class="s1content_link" href="http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/pubs/guide/minwage.php" target="_new">http://www.labour.gov.on.ca</a>.  The current minimum wage is indicated in the table below.  This became into effect on June 01, 2014. 
</p> 
<p class="s1content_body_section">
<span class="s1content_body_title">Pay Day:  </span>
Workers must be paid on a regularly scheduled pay day and must receive a statement that details wages earned and applicable deductions for that period (ESA section 11). 
</p> 		
<p class="s1content_body_section">
<span class="s1content_body_title">Vacation Time and Pay:  </span>
Most workers earn at least two weeks of vacation time per year.  Workers are entitled to be paid at least 4% of earned wages as vacation pay.  If you are unionized, vacation time and vacation pay may be superior to the ESA.  Refer to your collective agreement to ensure you are adhering to the language in the agreement (ESA section 33 – 35).</p> 
<p class="s1content_body_section">
<span class="s1content_body_title">Public Holidays:  </span>
Ontario has 9 public holidays.  For workers that work the public holiday they shall be paid regular pay for working the public holiday and be given another day off with regular pay, or shall be paid premium pay for working the public holiday ( ESA section 24).
</p> 
<p class="s1content_body_section">
<span class="s1content_body_title">Leave of Absence:    </span>
Generally workers have to be employed by the current employer for at least 13 weeks in order to be eligible to these unpaid, job-protected leaves (ESA section45-53):
</p> 
<ul>
        	<li class="s1content_body_section">
17 weeks of pregnancy leave.

</li>
            <li class="s1content_body_section">
Up to 37 weeks within a 52 week period leave to care for a critically ill child.   A “child” means a child, step-child, foster child or child who is under legal guardianship, and who is under 18 years of age.  This does not include children with chronic illness.
            </li>
            <li class="s1content_body_section">

		<h4 class="s1content_subtitle">Hazard Recognition and Control:</h4>
		<p class="s1content_body_section">Workers no matter how old or experienced they are will be exposed to the same hazards in their work environment.  It is important that young workers especially know about these hazards and understand how to protect themselves from them.  Employers and Supervisors have a responsibility to ensure all workers are adequately trained on hazard identification and control which includes safe handling of material and the selection, use and maintenance of protective equipment and devices.
        </p>
        <p class="s1content_body_section">To ensure young workers ask the right questions and ensure they are adequately trained and protected, here are a list of some key hazards and what they should know about them: 
        </p>
		<ol class="s1content_ordered_list">
        	<li class="s1content_body_section"><b>Chemicals, Biological or Infectious Agents: </b>Chemicals and other hazardous agents can be very dangerous if not adequately handled or stored.  All chemicals and substances must have WHMIS labels and MSDS’s that are required to be in the workplace and made available to workers on each chemical or substance being used.  Biological and infectious agents must be identified where possible as well and adequately controlled. Job specific WHMIS training must be provided by the employer, adequate PPE must be provided and procedures must be implemented and followed.
            </li>
            <li class="s1content_body_section"><b>Compressed Gas: </b> Compressed gas can be very dangerous if not adequately stored, handled or used.  It is important that Employers ensure workers are adequately trained in the safe handling, storage and use of compressed gas, that they supply an outside storage area for gas cylinders and that adequate PPE is provided and used.</li>
            <li class="s1content_body_section"><b>Temperature Extremes: </b> Regular or prolonged exposure to hot or cold temperatures can cause serious and possibly life threatening injuries. Employers are responsible for ensuring adequate hot and cold plans are in place, warm or cold rest facilities are made available and adequate clothing and PPE is used or worn.</li>
            <li class="s1content_body_section"><b>Machines: </b> Using machinery can be very dangerous, especially if they can cut, crush or strike a worker.  It is important that all machinery with access to these moving parts or any nip areas have adequate guarding on them or an emergency stop button to “lock them out” in case of an emergency. Employers must ensure these machines and their guards are adequately maintained in good working condition and that adequate training and PPE is provided to workers prior to operating the machinery.</li>
            <li class="s1content_body_section"><b>Power Tools: </b> Like machinery power tools can be very dangerous, especially when they are not adequately maintained or when workers have not been trained to use them.  Employers must ensure these power tools have adequate guards and adequate grounding to ensure workers are not electrocuted or otherwise injured from malfunctioning or unguarded equipment. They must also provide worker with adequate training and any PPE required to safely operate the equipment.</li>
           <li class="s1content_body_section"><b>Working Alone:  </b> It is very important that all workers have a “buddy system” when possible to ensure they do not work by themselves.  When this is not possible than the employer must ensure adequate measures and procedures are in place to protect workers; this includes (where possible) the use of security cameras, security systems or security guards, emergency numbers or anything else that would ensure the workers safety.  There are also some jobs that prohibit the workers from working alone, the employers should ensure they understand the jobs that MUST have more than one worker and comply with the regulations.</li>
